# Pharmacy-X Management System
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/GCxGwAssh_o>

#### INTRODUCTION:
- This project provides insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System and was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course during my second year at college.

#### Description:

- This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shop that has a database to maintain.
- The software can generate reports as per the userâ€™s requirements.
- It can print invoices, bills, receipts, etc., and maintain records of supplies sent by the supplier. It also provides a barcode reader to facilitate the addition or removal of medicines and includes a "Contradiction Alarm" to warn the seller of any medicine contradictions with the patient.

#### The Design:

- It consists of four main sections:
    - **Text Area:** Responsible for presenting all the outputs, search results, or system responses.
    - **Data Section:** Allows us to add, delete, and search any of the pharmacy's data.
    - **Finance Section:** Allows us to add medicines to the bill by scanning their barcodes and choose from a list of diseases that contradict with the medicines found in the pharmacy's database.
    - **Dashboard Section:** Provides statistics about the number of patients and medicines, and medicines nearing their expiration date.

## Objectives:

- To gain practical experience by modeling software based on a real-world problem.
- To understand how to work with Python, OOP, and Tkinter for the front end, and SQLite for the back end.
