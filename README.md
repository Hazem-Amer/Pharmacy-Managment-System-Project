#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/GCxGwAssh_o>

#### INTRODUCTION:

    The main aim of the project is the management of the database of the pharmaceutical shop. This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. This is done by creating a database of the available medicines in the shop. The primary aim of pharmacy management system is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim of this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.
#### Description:
    This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the userâ€™s requirements. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier.also it provides a barcode reader in order to make it easy to add or remove medicines, it also contains a "Contradiction Alarm"
    which warns the seller if there were any medicine contradiction with the patients
#### The Design:
    it consists of four main sections;
    first section is text area which is responsable for presenting all the outputs or search results or any system responses, second one is Database section which allows us to add, delete, search any of the pharmacies data,The third section is the finance sections which allows us to add medicines to the bill by scanning their barcodes and also to choose from a list of some diseases which contradicts with the medicines found in the pharmacies database, And finally the fourth one is the Dashboard section which provides some statistics about the number of patients and medicines, also the medicines nearly to their expiration date.
    By using MySQL commands and its database this website Pharmacy management tends to store all the data received from the users including drugs sales details and the profit made by the owners are all in this data base. This website allows the user to generate invoices for sales, check expiry and quantity remaining of the drugs. It also provides user with options to renew validity and add more drugs into the store and update the database accordingly. By using xampp server these database commands are easily initiated into the database and the ER diagram with relational schema diagrams helps us to make the structure of the database faster and it was easier to make them understand the needs of the website.

## Objectives:

Primary objective:

- To gain practical experience by modeling a software based on real world problem.
- To understand how to work with python,oop,tkinter for front end and Back-end (SQLite).

Secondary objective:

- To develop an application that deals with the day to day requirement of any pharmacy.
- To develop the easy management of the medicines (drugs).
