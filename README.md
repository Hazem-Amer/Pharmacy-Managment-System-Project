#### INTRODUCTION:

- The primary aim of pharmacy management system is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. 
- This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System.

- It consists of four main sections:
    - first section is text area which is responsable for presenting all the outputs or search results or any system responses.
    - second one is Database section which allows us to add, delete, search any of the pharmacies data.
    - The third section is the finance sections which allows us to add medicines to the bill by scanning their barcodes and also to choose from a list of some diseases       which contradicts with the medicines found in the pharmacies database.
    - And finally the fourth one is the Dashboard section which provides some statistics about the number of patients and medicines, also the medicines nearly to their       expiration date.
